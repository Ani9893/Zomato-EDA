Python offers several powerful libraries that can streamline your tasks. 
Here are some key libraries you might find useful

1. Pandas :-
   Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provides data structures like 
   DataFrames that are perfect for handling structured data, such as restaurant listings, ratings, and reviews from Zomato.

2. Numpy :-
   Fundamental for numerical operations in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional
   arrays and matrices, making it ideal for computations required during EDA.

3. Matplotlib :-
   A versatile plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
   It's excellent for plotting histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.
   to understand distributions, relationships, and trends in your data.

4. Seaborn :-
   Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive
   and informative statistical graphics. It's particularly useful for visualizing complex relationships and distributions in your data.
